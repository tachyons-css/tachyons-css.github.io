# Tachyons Documentation

Documentation for Tachyons -- a performant, mobile-first, and 100% responsive modular css framework.

## Installation and Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-css.github.io && cd $_
npm i && npm start
```

There are other scripts available to ease development, too. See the `"scripts"` section in the `package.json`.

The `index.html`, `components`, and `docs` directories are built files. Their source can be found in the `src/` directory.
CSS documentation is created using a bash script called `script.sh` and can be run with `$ npm run doc`.
Component documentation is part of the build script, and can be run with `$npm run build`.
